Positive relationships are particularly related to physicians’ communication skill.(56,57) A study suggested that ineffective communication were associated with patient’s poor understanding of disease, potential complications, and suboptimal medication adherence .(22) Another study showed that poor communication by physicians was associated with 19% higher risk of medication non-adherence.(58) On the contrary, training physicians in communication skills results in substantial and significant improvements in patient adherence (OR=1.62) comparing with physician receiving no training”(58)</p><p>Physicians can also impact complexity of medication regimens.(59) Avoidance of polypharmacy and multiple daily doses are associated with better adherence.
