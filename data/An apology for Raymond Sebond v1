Many people spend time reading it - especially ladies, to whom we owe greater courtesy. I have often been able to help them by relieving this book of the weight of the two main objections made against it. (Sebond’s aim is a bold and courageous one, since he undertakes to establish against the atheists and to show by human, natural reasons the truth of all the articles of the Christian religion.) Frankly, I find him so firm and so successful in this, that I do not think it is possible to do better on this topic and I do not believe that anyone has done so well. It seemed too rich and too fine a book for an author whose name is so obscure - all we know of him is that he was a Spaniard professing medicine in Toulouse some two hundred years ago; so I once asked Adrian Tumebus - who knew everything - what he made of it. 2 He replied that he thought it was a quintessence distilled from St Thomas 466 Aquinas, only a wit like Thomas’s, full of infinite learning and staggering subtlety, being capable of such concepts. Anyway, whoever it was who conceived and wrote this book (and it is not reasonable to deprive Sebond of his title without greater cause), he was a most talented man, having many fine accomplishments. The first charge made against the book is that Christians do themselves wrong by wishing to support their belief with human reasons: belief is grasped only by faith and by private inspiration from God’s grace. A pious zeal may be seen behind this objection; so any assay at satisfying those who put it forward must be made with gentleness and respect. It is really a task for a man versed in Theology rather than for me, who know nothing about it. Nevertheless, this is my verdict: in a matter so holy, so sublime, so far surpassing Man’s intellect as is that Truth by which it has pleased God in his goodness 2 to enlighten us, we can only grasp that Truth and lodge it within us if God favours us with the privilege of further help, beyond the natural order. I do not believe, then, that purely human means have the capacity to do this; if they had, many choice and excellent souls in ancient times - souls abundantly furnished with natural faculties - would not have failed to reach such knowledge by discursive reasoning. Only faith can embrace, with a lively certainty, the high mysteries of our religion.- But that is not to imply that it is other than a most fair and praiseworthy undertaking to devote to the service of our faith those natural, human tools which God has granted us. It is not to be doubted that it is the most honourable use that we could ever put them to and that there is no task, no design, more worthy of a Christian than to aim, by assiduous reflection, at beautifying, developing and clarifying the truth of his beliefs. We are not content merely to serve God with our spirits and our souls: we owe him more than that, doing him reverence with our bodies; we honour him with our very members, our actions and with things external. In the same way we must accompany our faith with all the reason that lies within us - but always with the reservation that we never reckon that faith depends upon ourselves or that our efforts and our conjectures can ever themselves attain to a knowledge so supernatural, so divine. If faith does not come and dwell within us as something infused, beyond the natural order; if she comes in, not just by reasoning but by any human means, then she is not there in her dignity and splendour. And yet I fear that we do only enjoy her presence in that way. If we held fast to God by means of a lively faith; if we held fast to God by God, not by ourselves; if our footing and our foundation were divine: then human events would not have the power to shake us which they do have; our fortress would not be for 467 surrendering to so feeble a battery; the love of novelty, the constraint of Princes, the good luck of one party or rash and fortuitous changes in our own opinions, would have no power to shake our beliefs or modify them. We would not let our faith be troubled at the mercy of some new argument or by persuasion - not by all the rhetoric there ever was. We would withstand such billows with a firmness, unbending and unmoved: I Hisos fluctus rnpes ut vasta refundit, Et varias circum latrantes dissipat undas Mole sua... [As a mighty rock, by its very mass, withstands the lashing waves, pouring them back and breaking up the waters raging round about it... ]&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>t///</div>"},{"idx":"511cd61b-e5fb-452a-9bf6-ead3727c63ed","name":"Christian's virtue: belief of Truth","NodeDescription":"///t&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> \n\nIf a ray of God’s light touched us even slightly, it would be everywhere apparent: not \nonly our words but our deeds would bear its lustre and its brightness. Everything \nemanating from us would be seen shining with that noble light. We ought to be \nashamed: among the schools of human philosophy there never was an initiate who did \nnot make his conduct and his life conform, at least in some respect, to their teachings, \nhowever difficult or strange: and yet so holy and heavenly an ordinance as ours only \nmarks Christians on their tongues. \n\n[B] Do you want to see that for yourself? Then compare our behaviour with a \nMoslem’s or a pagan’s: you always remain lower than they are. Yet, given the advantage \nof our own religion, our superiority ought to outshine them, far beyond any comparison. \nMen ought to say: ‘Are they really so just, so loving, so good? Then these people must \nbe Christians.’- [C] All other manifestations are common to all religions: hope, trust, \ndeliverances, ceremonies, penances and martyrdoms. The distinctive mark of the Truth \nwe hold ought to be virtue, which is the most exacting mark of Truth, the closest one to \nheaven and the most worthy thing that Truth produces. \n\n[B] That is why our good Saint Louis was right, when the Tartar king who was \nconverted to Christianity planned to come to Lyons to kiss the Pope’s feet and to study \nthe holiness he hoped to find in our behaviour, to turn him away from it at once, fearing \nthat our disordered way of life would sour his taste for so sacred a belief .- \n\nThe actual outcome, on the other hand, was different for that later convert who went \nto Rome for the same purpose: seeing the dissolute life of the prelates and people there \nat that time, he became even more firmly attached to our religion: he considered how \nmuch strength and holiness it must have to be able to maintain its dignity and splendour \nin the midst of corruption so great, in hands so vicious! 14 \n\n\n468 \n\n\n[A] The Word of God says that if we had one single drop of faith we would ‘move \nmountains’:- our actions, guided and accompanied by God, would not be simply human: \nthey would partake of the miraculous, just as our belief does. [C] ‘Brevis est institutio \nvitae honestae beataeque, si creclas ’ [Laying the principles for an honourable and blessed \nlife is soon done... if you believe]. - \n\nSome people make the world believe that they hold beliefs they do not hold. A \ngreater number make themselves believe it, having no idea what ‘believing’ really means, \nonce you go deeply into the matter. [A] We find it strange when, in the wars now \nbesetting our country, we see the outcome of events drifting and changing in a manner \nmarked by nothing unusual or beyond the natural order. That is because we bring to it \nnothing beyond ourselves. There is Justice on one of the sides, but only as a decoration \nand a cloak - often cited but never received, welcomed and truly wedded. Justice is \nlodged as in the mouth of a lawyer, not as in the heart and emotions of the man whose \nsuit it is. God owes help - beyond the natural order - to our faith, to our religion: he \ndoes not owe it to our passions. 1 Men take the lead in them, making use of religion: \nthings ought to be clean contrary.- \n\n[C] Think whether we do not take religion into our own hands and twist it like wax \ninto shapes quite opposed to a rule so unbending and direct. Has that ever been seen \nmore clearly than in France today? Some approach it from this side, some from the \nother; some make it black, others make it white: all are alike in using religion for their \nviolent and ambitious schemes, so like each other in managing their affairs with excess \nand injustice, that they make you doubt whether they really do hold different opinions \nover a matter on which depends the way we conduct and regulate our lives. Could you \nfind behaviour more like, more closely identical even, coming from the same teaching in \nthe same school? Just see the horrifying impudence with which we toss theological \narguments to and fro and how irreligiously we cast them off or take them up again, \nwhenever we happen to switch places in these civil tumults. Take that most formal \nproposition: Whether it be permitted for a Subject to rebel and to take up arms against \nhis Ruler, in defence of his religion? First, remember which side, only last year, was \nmouthing the affirmative, making it the buttress of their faction, and what side was \nmouthing the negative, making their buttress out of that. Then listen from what quarter \ncome voices defending which side now, and judge whether they are rattling their swords \nless for this side than they did for the other!- We burn people at the stake for saying \nthat Truth must bow to our necessities: and, in France, how much worse is what we do \nthan what we say! \n\n[A] Let us confess the truth: pick out, even from the lawful, moderate army,- those \n\n\n469 \n\n\nwho are fighting simply out of zeal for their religious convictions; then add those who \nare concerned only to uphold the laws of their country and to serve their King: you \nwould not have enough to form one full company of fighting men. How does it happen \nthat so few can be found who maintain a consistent will and action in our civil \ndisturbances? How does it happen that you can see them sometimes merely ambling \nalong, sometimes charging headlong - the very same men sometimes ruining our affairs \nby their violence and harshness and at other times by their lukewarmness, their softness \nand their sloth? It must be that they have been motivated by private concerns, [C] by \nones due to chance; [A] as these change, so do they. \n\n[C] It is evident to me that we only willingly carry out those religious duties which \nflatter our passions. Christians excel at hating enemies. Our zeal works wonders when it \nstrengthens our tendency towards hatred, enmity, ambition, avarice, evil-speaking... and \nrebellion. On the other hand, zeal never makes anyone go flying towards goodness, \nkindness or temperance, unless he is miraculously pre-disposed to them by some rare \ncomplexion. Our religion was made to root out vices: now it cloaks them, nurses them, \nstimulates them. \n\n[A] There is a saying: ‘Do not try to palm off sheaves of straw on God.’ If we \nbelieved in God - I do not mean by faith but merely with bare credence, indeed (and I \nsay it to our great shame) if we believed him and knew him just as we believe historical \nevents or one of our companions, then we would love him above all other things, on \naccount of the infinite goodness and beauty shining within him: at the very least he \nwould march equal in the ranks of our affections with riches, pleasure, glory and \nfriends.- [C] The best among us does not fear to offend him as much as offending \nneighbour, kinsman, master. On this side there is the object of one of our vicious \npleasures: on the other, the glorious state of immortality, equally known and equally \nconvincing - is there anyone so simple-minded as to barter one for the other? And yet \nwe often give it up altogether, out of pure contempt; for what attracts us to blasphemy \nexcept, perhaps, the taste of the offence itself? \n\nAntisthenes, the philosopher, was being initiated into the Orphic mysteries; the \npriest said that those who make their religious profession would receive after death joys, \nperfect and everlasting. He replied: ‘Why do you not die yourself then?’ Diogenes’ retort \nwas more brusque (that was his fashion) and rather off our subject: when the priest was \npreaching at him to join his order so as to obtain the blessings of the world to come, he \nreplied: ‘Are you asking me to believe that great men like Agesilaus and Epaminondas \nwill be wretched, whilst a calf like you will be happy, just because you are a priest? - \n\n[A] If we were to accept the great promises of everlasting blessedness as having the \n\n\n470 \n\n\nsame authority as a philosophical argument, no more, we would not hold death in such \nhorror as we do: \n\n\n[B] Non jam se moriens dissolvi conquereretur; \nSed magis ire foras, vestemque relinquere, ut anguis, \nGauderet, praelonga senex aut cornua cervus. \n\n\n[The dying man would not then complain that he is being ‘loosened asunder’, but \nwould, rather, rejoice to be ‘going outside’, like a snake casting off its skin, or an old \nstag casting off his over-long antlers. ]- \n\n[A] ‘I wish to be loosened asunder’, he would say, ‘and to be with Jesus Christ.’ The \nforce of Plato’s dialogue on the immortality of the soul led some of his disciples to kill \nthemselves, the sooner to enjoy the hopes which he gave them.- \n\nAll this is a clear sign that we accept our religion only as we would fashion it, only \nfrom our own hands - no differently from the way other religions gain acceptance. We \nhappen to be bom in a country where it is practised, or else we have regard for its age or \nfor the authority of the men who have upheld it; perhaps we fear the threats which it \nattaches to the wicked or go along with its promises. Such considerations as these must \nbe deployed in defence of our beliefs, but only as support-troops. Their bonds are \nhuman. Another region, other witnesses, similar promises or similar menaces, would, in \nthe same way, stamp a contrary belief on us. [B] We are Christians by the same title \nthat we are Perigordians or Germans. \n\n[A] Plato said few men are so firm in their atheism that a pressing danger does not \nbring them to acknowledge divine power;- such behaviour has nothing to do with a true \nChristian; only mortal, human religions become accepted by human procedures. What \nsort of faith must it be that is planted by cowardice and established in us by feebleness \nof heart! [C] What an agreeable faith, which believes what it believes, because it is not \nbrave enough to disbelieve it! [A] How can vicious passions, such as inconstancy and \nsudden dismay, produce in our souls anything right? \n\n[C] Plato says that people first decide, by reasoned judgement, that what is told \nabout hell and future punishment is just fiction. But when they have the opportunity \nreally to find out, by experience, when old age or illness brings them close to death, then \nthe terror of it fills them with belief again, out of horror for what awaits them. \n\nTo impress such ideas upon people is to make them timorous of heart: that is why \nPlato in his Laws forbids any teaching of threats such as these or of any conviction that \nill can come to Man from the gods. (When it does happen, it is for man’s greater good \n\n\n471 \n\n\nor like a medical purgation. )- \n\nThey tell that Bion, infected by the atheistic teachings of Theodorus, used to mock \nreligious men; but eventually, when death approached, he gave himself over to the most \nextreme superstitions, as though the gods took themselves off and brought themselves \nback according to the needs of Bion.- \n\nPlato - and these examples - lead to the conclusion that either love or force can \nbring us back to a belief in God. Atheism, as a proposition, is a monstrous thing, \nstripped, as it were, of natural qualities. It is awkward and difficult to fix it firmly in the \nhuman spirit, however impudent or however unruly. We have seen plenty of people who \nare egged on by vanity and pride to conceive lofty opinions for setting the world to \nrights; to put themselves in countenance they affect to profess atheism: but even if they \nare mad enough to try and plant it in their consciousness, they are not strong enough to \ndo so. Give them a good thrust through the breast with your sword and they never fail to \nraise clasped hands to heaven. And when fear or sickness has cooled down the licentious \nfever-heat of that transient humour, they never fail to come back to themselves again, \nletting themselves be reconciled to recognized standards and beliefs. Seriously digested \ndoctrine is one thing: these surface impressions are quite another. They are bom of a \nmind unhinged, in the spirit of debauchery; they drift rashly and erratically about in the \nfancies of men. What wretched, brainless men they are, trying to be worse than they can \nbe! \n\n[A] That great soul [C] of Plato [A] - great, however, with merely human greatness \n- was led into a neighbouring mistake by the error of paganism and his ignorance of our \nholy Truth: he held that it is children and old men who are most susceptible to religion, \nas if religion were born of human weakness and drew her credibility from it.<br> t///<div></div><div><br></div>///h<div>Muslems and Muslims.

Moreover, it is simply not believable that there should be no prints \r\nwhatsoever impressed upon the fabric of this world by the hand of the great Architect, \r\nor that there should not be at least some image within created things relating to the \r\nWorkman who made them and fashioned them. He has left within these lofty works the \r\nimpress of his Godhead: only our weakness stops us from discovering it. He tells us \r\nhimself that he makes manifest his unseen workings through those things which are \r\n\r\n\r\n472 \r\n\r\n\r\nseen. Sebond toiled at this honourable endeavour, showing us that there is no piece \r\nwithin this world which belies its Maker. God’s goodness would be put in the wrong if \r\nthe universe were not compatible with our beliefs. All things, Heaven, Earth, the \r\nelements, our bodies and our souls are in one accord: we simply have to find how to use \r\nthem. If we have the capacity to understand, they will teach us. [B] For this world is a \r\nmost holy Temple into which Man has been brought in order to contemplate the Sun, \r\nthe heavenly bodies, the waters and the dry land - objects not sculpted by mortal hands \r\nbut made manifest to our senses by the Divine Mind in order to represent intelligibles. \r\n[A] “The invisible things of God’, says St Paul, ‘are clearly seen from the creation of the \r\nworld, his Eternal Wisdom and his Godhead being perceived from the things he has \r\nmade.’- \r\n\r\n\r\nAtque adeo faciem coeli non invidet orbi \r\nIpse Deus, vultusque suos corpusque recludit \r\nSemper volvendo; seque ipsum inculcat et offert, \r\nUt bene cognosci possit, doceatque videndo \r\nQualis eat, doceatque suas attendere leges. \r\n\r\n\r\n[God himself does not begrudge to the world the sight of the face of heaven, which, \r\never-rolling, unveils his countenance, his incorporate being inculcating and offering \r\nhimself to us, so that he may be known full well; he teaches the man who contemplates \r\nto recognize his state, teaches him, also, to wait upon his laws.]- \r\n\r\nOur human reasonings and concepts are like matter, heavy and barren: God’s grace \r\nis their form, giving them shape and worth. The virtuous actions of Socrates and of \r\nCato remain vain and useless, since they did not have, as their end or their aim, love of \r\nthe true Creator of all things nor obedience to him: they did not know God; the same \r\napplies to our concepts and thoughts: they have a body of sorts, but it is a formless mass, \r\nunenlightened and without shape, unless accompanied by faith in God and by grace. \r\nWhen Faith tinges the themes of Sebond and throws her light upon them, she makes \r\nthem firm and solid. They then have the capacity of serving as a finger-post, as an \r\nelementary guide setting an apprentice on the road leading to knowledge such as this; \r\nthey fashion him somewhat into shape and make him capable of God’s grace, which \r\nthen furnishes out our belief and perfects it. \r\n\r\nI know a man of authority, a cultured, educated man, who admitted to me that he \r\nhad been led back from the errors of disbelief by means of the arguments of Sebond. \r\nEven if you were to strip them of their ornaments and of the help and approbation of \r\nFaith - even if you were to take them for purely human notions - you would find, when \r\nit comes to fighting those who have plunged down into the dreadful, horrible darkness \r\n\r\n\r\n473 \r\n\r\n\r\nof irreligion, that they still remain more solid and more firm than any others of the same \r\nkind which you can set up against them. We rightly can say to our opponents, Si melius \r\nquid habes, accerse, vel imperium fer’ [If you have anything better, produce it, or \r\nsubmit]:- let them allow the force of our proofs or else show us others, elsewhere, on \r\nanother subject, as closely woven or of better stuff. \r\n\r\nWithout thinking I have already half-slipped into the second of the charges which I \r\nset out to counter on behalf of Sebond. \r\n\r\nSome say that his arguments are weak and unsuited to what he wants to \r\ndemonstrate; they set out to batter them down with ease. People like those need to be \r\nshaken rather more roughly, since they are more dangerous than the first and more \r\nmalicious. [C] We are only too willing to couch other men’s writings in senses which \r\nfavour our settled opinions: an atheist prides himself on bringing all authors into accord \r\nwith atheism, poisoning harmless matter with his own venom.- [A] Such people have \r\nsome mental prepossession which makes Sebond’s reasons seem insipid. Moreover it \r\nseems to them that they have been allowed an easy game, with freedom to fight against \r\nour religion with purely human weapons: they would never dare to attack her in the full \r\nmajesty of her imperious authority. The means I use and which seem more fitted to \r\nabating such a frenzy is to trample down human pride and arrogance, crushing them \r\nunder our feet; I make men feel the emptiness, the vanity, the nothingness of Man, \r\nwrenchingfrom their grasp the sickly arms of human reason, making them bow their \r\nheads and bite the dust before the authority and awe of the Divine Majesty, to whom \r\nalone belong knowledge and wisdom; who alone can esteem himself in any way, and \r\nfrom whom we steal whatever worth or value we pride ourselves on: \r\nOu yap ea (ppoveiv 3 Oedg peya akXov fj ecozov [q oc j permits no one to esteem him self \r\n\r\nhigher].<br /> t///"},{"idx":"ea3e391f-7c29-4652-9c5f-2f5851bdcca8","name":4,"NodeDescription":"///t <br /> \r\n\r\n[C] Let us smash down such presumption. It is the very foundation of the tyrannous \r\nrule of the Evil Spirit: ‘Deus superbis resistit; humilibus autem dat gratiam ’ [God resisteth \r\nthe proud, and giveth grace to the humble]. ‘There is intelligence in all the gods,’ says \r\nPlato, ‘but very little of it in men.’- \r\n\r\n[A] Yet it is a great source of consolation to a Christian man to see our transitory \r\nmortal tools so properly matched to our holy and divine faith that when we use them on \r\nsubjects which, like them, are transitory and mortal, it is precisely then that they are \r\nmost closely and most powerfully matched. Let us try and see, then, whether a man has \r\nin his power any reasons stronger than those of Sebond - whether, indeed, it is in man \r\nto arrive at any certainty by argument and reflection. \r\n\r\n[C] St Augustine, pleading his case against presumptuous people, has cause to \r\n\r\n\r\n474 \r\n\r\n\r\ncriticize their injustice when they consider those parts of our faith to be false which \r\nhuman reason is unable to establish. In order to show that many things can exist or have \r\nhad existence, even though their nature and causes have no foundation which can be \r\nfixed by rational discourse, he advances various indubitable, recognized experiences, for \r\nwhich Man admits he can see no explanation. Augustine does this, as he does all things, \r\nafter careful and intelligent search.- We must do even more, teaching such people the \r\nlesson that the weakness of their reason can be proved without our having to marshal \r\nrare examples; that reason is so inadequate, so blind, that there is no example so clear \r\nand easy as to be clear enough for her; that the easy and the hard are all one to her; that \r\nall subjects and Nature in general equally deny her any sway or jurisdiction. \r\n\r\n[A] What is Truth teaching us, when she preaches that we must fly from the wisdom \r\nof this world; when she so frequently urges that what seems wise to Man is but \r\nfoolishness to God; that of all vain things, Man is the most vain; that a man who dares to \r\npresume that he knows anything, does not even know what knowledge is; that Man, who \r\nis nothing yet thinks he is something, misleads and deceives himself? These are verdicts \r\nof the Holy Ghost;- they express so clearly and so vividly what I myself wish to uphold \r\nthat I would need no other proof to use against people who, with due submission and \r\nobedience, would surrender to his authority. But these people simply ask to be whipped, \r\nand will not let us fight their reason, save by reason alone. \r\n\r\nSo let us consider for a while Man in isolation - Man with no outside help, armed \r\nwith no arms but his own and stripped of that grace and knowledge of God in which \r\nconsist his dignity, his power and the very ground of his being.- Let us see how much \r\nconstancy there is in all his fine panoply. Let Man make me understand, by the force of \r\ndiscursive reason, what are the grounds on which he has founded and erected all those \r\nadvantages which he thinks he has over other creatures and who has convinced him that \r\nit is for his convenience, his service, that, for so many centuries, there has been \r\nestablished and maintained the awesome motion of the vault of heaven, the everlasting \r\nlight of those tapers coursing so proudly overhead or the dread surging of the boundless \r\nsea? Is it possible to imagine anything more laughable than that this pitiful, wretched \r\ncreature - who is not even master of himself, but exposed to shocks on every side - \r\nshould call himself Master and Emperor of a universe, the smallest particle of which he \r\nhas no means of knowing, let alone swaying! Man claims the privilege of being unique \r\nin that, within this created frame, he alone is able to recognize its structure and its \r\nbeauty; he alone is able to render thanks to its Architect or to tot up the profit or loss of \r\nthe world... But who impressed his seal on such a privilege? If Man has been given so \r\ngreat and fair a commission, let him produce documents saying so. [C] Were they drawn \r\nup in favour of wise men only? (They apply to few enough!)- Are fools and knaves \r\n\r\n\r\n475 \r\n\r\n\r\nworthy of a favour so far exceeding the normal order - the worst thing in the world \r\nexalted above all others? Are we supposed to believe that fellow who wrote: ‘Quorum \r\nigitur causa quis dixerit effectum esse mundum? Eorum scilicet animantium quae ratione \r\nutuntur. Hi sunt dii et homines , quibus profecto nihil est melius ’ [Who will tell for whose \r\nsake this world has been brought about?

The vanity of this same \r\nthought makes him equal himself to God; attribute to himself God’s mode of being; \r\npick himself out and set himself apart from the mass of other creatures; and (although \r\nthey are his fellows and his brothers) carve out for them such helpings of force or \r\nfaculties as he thinks fit. How can he, from the power of his own understanding, know \r\nthe hidden, inward motivations of animate creatures?

By this means Man used to acquire a full understanding and \r\ndiscretion, leading his life far more happily than we ever can now. After that, do we \r\nneed a better proof of the impudence of Man towards beast?

On this subject Aristotle cites the ways in \r\nwhich the call of the partridge varies from place to place. \r\n\r\n\r\n[B] variaeque volucres \r\nLonge alias alio jaciunt in tempore voces, \r\n\r\n\r\n484 \r\n\r\n\r\nEt partim mutant cum tempestatibus una \r\nRaucisonos cantus. \r\n\r\n\r\n[At different times some birds utter highly different sounds, some even making their \r\nsongs more raucous with changes in the weather.] \r\n\r\n[A] But we do not know what language an isolated child would actually speak and \r\nthe guesses made about it all seem improbable.- \r\n\r\nIf anyone challenges my opinion, citing the fact that people who are born deaf never \r\nlearn to talk at all, I have an answer to that: it is not simply because they are unable to \r\nreceive instruction in speech through the ear but rather because of the intimate \r\nrelationship which exists between the faculty of hearing (the power they are deprived of) \r\nand the faculty of speech, which are by their nature closely sutured together. Whenever \r\nwe talk, we must first talk as it were to ourselves: our speech first sounds in our own \r\nears, then we utter it into the ears of other people. \r\n\r\nI have gone into all this to emphasize similarities with things human, so bringing \r\nMan into conformity with the majority of creatures. We are neither above them nor \r\nbelow them. ‘Everything under the Sky’, said the Wise Man, ‘runs according to like laws \r\nand fortune.- \r\n\r\n\r\n[B] Indupedita suis fatalibus omnia vinclis. \r\n\r\n\r\n[All things are enchained in the fetters of their destiny.] \r\n\r\n\r\n[A] Some difference there is: there are orders and degrees: but always beneath the \r\ncountenance of Nature who is one and the same. \r\n\r\n\r\n[B] res quaeque suo ritu procedit, et omnes \r\nFoedere naturae certo discrimina servant. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Each thing proceeds after its own manner, and all things maintain their distinctive \r\nqualities by the fixed compact of Nature.]- \r\n\r\n[A] Man must be restrained, with his own rank, within the boundary walls of this \r\npolity: the wretch has no stomach for effectively clambering over them; he is trussed up \r\nand bound, subject to the same restraints as the other creatures of his natural order. His \r\ncondition is a very modest one. As for his essential being, he has no true privilege or \r\npre-eminence: what he thinks or fancies he has, has no savour, no body to it. Granted \r\n\r\n\r\n485 \r\n\r\n\r\nthat, of all the animals, Man alone has freedom to think and such unruly ways of doing \r\nso that he can imagine things which are and things which are not, imagine his wishes, or \r\nthe false and the true! but he has to pay a high price for this advantage - and he has little \r\ncause to boast about it, since it is the chief source of the woes which beset him: sin, \r\nsickness, irresolution, confusion and despair. \r\n\r\nTo get back to the subject, there is, I say, no rational likelihood that beasts are \r\nforced to do by natural inclination the selfsame things which we do by choice and \r\ningenuity. From similar effects we should conclude that there are similar faculties. \r\nConsequently, we should admit that animals employ the same method and the same \r\nreasoning as ourselves when we do anything.- Why should we think that they have inner \r\nnatural instincts different from anything we experience in ourselves? Added to which, it \r\nis more honourable that we be guided towards regular, obligatory behaviour by the \r\nnatural and ineluctable properties of our being: that is more God-like than rash and \r\nfortuitous freedom; it is safer to leave the driver’s reins in Nature’s hands, not ours. Our \r\nempty arrogance makes us prefer to owe our adequacies to our selves rather than to the \r\nbounty of Nature; we prefer to lavish the natural goods on other animals, giving them up \r\nso as to flatter and honour ourselves with acquired properties. We do that, it seems to \r\nme, out of some simple-minded humour. Personally I value graces which are mine since \r\nI was bom with them more than those which I have had to beg and borrow as an \r\napprentice. It is not within our power to acquire a higher recommendation than to be \r\nfavoured by God and Nature. \r\n\r\nConsider the fox which Thracians employ when they want to cross the ice of a \r\nfrozen river; with this end in view they let it loose. Were we to see it stopping at the \r\nriver’s edge, bringing its ear close to the ice to judge from the noise how near to the \r\nsurface the current is running; darting forward or pulling back according to its estimate \r\nof the thickness or thinness of the ice, would it not be right to conclude that the same \r\nreasoning passes through its head as would pass through ours and that it ratiocinates and \r\ndraws consequences by its natural intelligence like this: ‘That which makes a noise is \r\nmoving; that which moves is not frozen; that which is not frozen is liquid; that which is \r\nliquid bends under weight’? Attributing all that exclusively to its keen sense of hearing, \r\nwithout any reasoning or drawing of consequences on the part of the fox, is unthinkable, \r\na chimera. The same judgement should apply to all the ingenious ruses by which beasts \r\nprotect themselves from our schemes against them. \r\n\r\nShould we pride ourself on our ability to capture them and make them work for us? \r\nBut that is no more than the advantage we have over each other: our slaves are in the \r\nsame condition. [B] Were not the Climacides Syrian slave-women who went down on all \r\n\r\n\r\n486 \r\n\r\n\r\nfours to serve as steps or ladders for the ladies to climb up into their coaches? [A] Even \r\nthe majority of free men and women, for very slight advantages, place themselves in the \r\npower of others. [C] Thracian wives and concubines beg to be selected for slaughter \r\nover the dead husband’s tomb. [A] Have tyrants ever failed to find men sworn and \r\ndevoted to them - even though some require them to follow them in death as in life? [B] \r\nWhole armies have been bound to their captains that way. \r\n\r\nThe form of oath used in that rough school which trained gladiators to fight to the \r\nfinish included the vows: ‘We swear to let ourselves be fettered, burned, beaten or killed \r\nby the sword, suffering all that true gladiators suffer at the hands of their Master’; they \r\nmost scrupulously bound themselves, body and soul, to his service: \r\n\r\n\r\nUre meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro \r\nCorpus, et intorto verbere terga seca. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Burn my head, if you will, with fire, plunge your iron sword through my body or \r\nlash my back with your twisted thongs.] \r\n\r\nIt was a real, binding undertaking. And yet, one year, ten thousand men were found \r\nto enter that school and perish there. \r\n\r\n[C] When the Scythians buried their king, over his body they strangled his favourite \r\nconcubine, his cup-bearer, his ostler, his chamberlain, the guard to his bedchamber and \r\nhis cook. And on the anniversary of his death they would take fifty pages mounted on \r\nfifty horses and kill them, impaling them from behind, from spine to throat, and leaving \r\nthem dead on parade about his tomb.- \r\n\r\n[A] The men who serve us do so more cheaply than our falcons, our horses or our \r\nhounds; and they are less carefully looked after - [C] what menial tasks will we not bow \r\nto for the convenience of those animals! The most abject slaves, it seems to me, will not \r\nwillingly do for their masters what princes are proud to do for such creatures. When \r\nDiogenes saw his parents striving to purchase his freedom he exclaimed: ‘They must be \r\nfools: my Master looks after me and feeds me; he is my servant !’ 11 So too those who \r\nkeep animals can be said to serve them, not be served by them. \r\n\r\n[A] There is as well a nobility in animals such that, from want of courage, no lion \r\nhas ever been enslaved to another lion; no horse to another horse. We go out to hunt \r\nanimals: lions and tigers go out to hunt men; each beast practises a similar sport against \r\nanother: hounds against hares; pike against tenches; swallows against grasshoppers; \r\nsparhawks against blackbirds and skylarks: \r\n\r\n\r\n487 \r\n\r\n\r\n[B] serpente ciconia pullos \r\nNutrit, et inventa per devia rura lacerta, \r\n\r\nEt leporem aut capream famulae Jovis, et generosae \r\nIn saltu venantur aves. \r\n\r\n\r\n[The stork feeds her young on snakes and on lizards found in trackless country \r\nplaces; eagles, those noble birds, servants of Jupiter, hunt hares and roes in the \r\nforests. ]<br /> t///"},{"idx":"fe3a5c72-ea09-425f-aecb-9f4af75ae11c","name":11,"NodeDescription":"///t <br /> \r\n\r\nWe share the fruits of the chase with our hounds and our hawks, as well as its skill \r\nand hardships. In Thrace, above Amphipolis, huntsmen and wild falcons each share a \r\nhalf of the booty, very exactly, just as the fisherman by the marshes of the Sea of Azov \r\nsets aside, in good faith, half of his catch for the wolves: if not, they go and tear his nets. \r\n\r\n[A] We have a kind of hunting conducted more with cunning than with force, as \r\nwhen we use gin-traps, hooks and lines. Similar things are found among beasts. \r\nAristotle relates that the cuttle-fish casts a line of gut from its neck, pays it out and lets \r\nit float. When it wants to, it draws it in. It spots some little fish approaching, remains \r\nhiding in the sand or mud and allows it to nibble at the end of the gut and gradually \r\ndraws it in until that little fish is so close it can pounce on it. \r\n\r\nAs for force, no animal in the world is liable to so many shocks as Man. No need for \r\na whale, an elephant, a crocodile or animals like that, any one of which can destroy a \r\ngreat number of men. Lice were enough to make Sylla’s dictatorship vacant; and the \r\nheart and life-blood of a great and victorious Emperor serve as breakfast for some tiny \r\nworm. \r\n\r\nWhy do we say, in the case of Man, that distinguishing plants which are useful for \r\nlife or for medicines from those which are not (recognizing, say, the virtues of rhubarb \r\nor polypody) is a sign that he has scientific knowledge based on skill and reason? Yet \r\nthe goats of Candia can be seen picking out dittany from a million other plants when \r\nthey are wounded by spears; if a tortoise swallows a viper it at once goes in search of \r\noriganum as a purge; the dragon wipes its eyes clear and bright with fennel; storks give \r\nthemselves salt-water enemas; elephants can remove darts and javelins thrown in battle \r\nfrom their own bodies, from those of their fellows and even from those of their masters \r\n(witness the elephant of that King Porus who was killed by Alexander); they do so with \r\nmore skill than we ever could while causing so little pain. Why do we not call it \r\nknowledge and discretion in their case? To lower them in esteem we allege that Nature \r\nalone is their Schoolmaster; but that is not to deprive them of knowledge or wisdom: it \r\nis to attribute them to them more surely than to ourselves, out of respect for so certain a \r\nTeacher. \r\n\r\n\r\n488 \r\n\r\n\r\nIn all other cases Chrysippus was as scornful a judge of the properties of animals as \r\nany philosopher there ever was, yet he watched the actions of a dog which came upon \r\nthree crossroads - it was either looking for its master or chasing some game fleeing \r\nbefore it; it tried first one road then a second; then, having made sure that neither of \r\nthem bore any trace of what it was looking for, it charged down the third road without \r\nhesitation. Chrysippus was forced to admit that that dog at least reasoned this way: ‘I \r\nhave tracked my master as far as these crossroads; he must have gone down one of these \r\nthree paths; not this one; not that one; so, inevitably, he must have gone down this other \r\none.’ Convinced by this reasoned conclusion, it did not sniff at the third path; it made no \r\nfurther investigations but let itself be swayed by the power of reason. Here was pure \r\ndialectic: the dog made use of disjunctive and copulative propositions and adequately \r\nenumerated the parts. Does it matter whether he learned all this from himself or from \r\nthe Dialectica of George of Trebizond? \r\n\r\nYet beasts, like us, are not incapable of instruction. Blackbirds, ravens, magpies and \r\nparrots can be taught to speak:- we recognize in them a capacity for making their voice \r\nand their breath subtle and pliant enough for us to mould and restrict them to a definite \r\nnumber of letters and syllables. That capacity witnesses to an inward power of reasoning \r\nwhich makes them teachable - and willing to learn. We have all had our fill I expect of \r\nthe sort of monkey-tricks which minstrels teach their dogs to do: those dances in which \r\nthey never miss a note they hear or those varied jumps and movements which they \r\nperform on command. But I am much more moved to wonder by the action of the \r\nguide-dogs used by the blind in town and country, common enough as they are. I have \r\nwatched those dogs stop at certain doors where people regularly give alms, and seen \r\nhow, even when there is room enough to squeeze through themselves, they still avoid \r\nencounters with carts and coaches; I have seen one, following the town trench but \r\nabandoning a level, even path for a worse one, in order to keep its master away from the \r\nditch. How was that dog brought to realize that it was its duty to neglect its own interests \r\nand to serve its master? How does it know that a path might be wide enough for itself \r\nbut not wide enough for a blind man? Could all that be grasped without thought and \r\nreasoning? \r\n\r\nI should not overlook what Plutarch tells us about a dog he saw with the elder \r\nVespasian, the Emperor, in the theatre of Marcellus in Rome. This dog served a juggler \r\nwho was putting on a play with several scenes and several parts. The dog had its own \r\npart: it had to pretend, among other things, to swallow some poison and to lie dead for a \r\nwhile. First it swallowed the supposedly poisoned bread; then it began to shake and \r\ntremble as though it were dizzy; finally, it lay down and stiffened as though it were dead. \r\nIt let itself be pulled about and dragged from one place to another, as the plot required. \r\n\r\n\r\n489 \r\n\r\n\r\nThen, when it knew the time was right, it began to stir very gently, as though awakening \r\nfrom a deep sleep and raised its head, looking from side to side in a way which made the \r\naudience thunderstruck. \r\n\r\nOxen were used to water the Royal Gardens of Susa: they had to draw up the water \r\nby turning large wheels with buckets attached - you can see plenty of them in \r\nLanguedoc. Each one had been ordered to do one hundred turns of the wheel a day. \r\nThey grew so used to this number that nothing would force them to do one more; when \r\ntheir alloted task had been done they stopped dead. Yet we have reached adolescence \r\nbefore we can count up to a hundred; and we have just discovered peoples with no \r\nknowledge of numbers at all. \r\n\r\nYou need still greater powers of reason to teach others than to be taught yourself. \r\nDemocritus thought, and proved, that we had been taught most of our arts by animals: \r\nthe spider taught us to weave and to sew and the swallow to build; the swan and \r\nnightingale taught us music and many other animals taught us by imitation the practice \r\nof medicine. Moreover, Aristotle maintains that nightingales teach their young to sing, \r\nspending time and trouble doing so: that explains why the song of nightingales brought \r\nup in cages, with no freedom to be schooled by their parents, loses much of its charm. \r\n[B] From that we may conclude that any improvement is due to learning and study. \r\n\r\nEven nightingales born free do not all sing one and the same song: each one sings \r\naccording to its capacity to leam. They make jealous classmates, squabbling and vying \r\nwith each other so heartily that the vanquished sometimes drops down dead, not from \r\nlack of song but lack of breath. The youngest birds ruminate thoughtfully and then \r\nbegin to imitate snatches of song; the pupils listen to the lessons of their tutors and then \r\ngive an account of themselves, taking it in turns to stop their singing. You can hear their \r\nfaults being corrected; some of the criticisms of their tutors are perceptible even to us. \r\n\r\nArrius- said that he once saw an elephant with cymbals hanging from each thigh \r\nand a third on its trunk; the other elephants danced round in a ring, rising and falling to \r\nthe cadences of this musical instrument, which was harmonious and pleasant to listen to. \r\n[A] In the great spectacles of Rome it was quite usual to see elephants trained to execute \r\ndance steps to the sound of the human voice; such performances comported several \r\nintricate movements, interlacings, changes of step and cadenzas, all very hard to learn. \r\nSome were seen revising their lessons in private, practising and studying so as to avoid \r\nbeing beaten or scolded by their masters. \r\n\r\nBut strange indeed is the account of a female magpie vouched for by Plutarch, no \r\nless. It lived in a barber’s shop in Rome and was wonderfully clever at imitating any \r\nsounds it heard. It happened one day that some musicians stopped quite a while in front \r\n\r\n\r\n490 \r\n\r\n\r\nof the shop, blasting away on their trumpets. Immediately the magpie fell pensive, mute \r\nand melancholic, remaining so all the following day. Everyone marvelled, thinking that \r\nthe blare of the trumpets had frightened and confused it, making it lose both hearing \r\nand song at the same time. But they eventually found that it had been deeply meditating \r\nand had withdrawn into itself; it had been inwardly practising, preparing its voice to \r\nimitate the noise of those trumpeters. The first sound it did make was a perfect \r\nimitation of their changes, repetitions and stops; after this new apprenticeship it quit \r\nwith disdain all that it was able to do before. \r\n\r\nI do not want to leave out another example of a dog, also seen by Plutarch. (I realize \r\nI am digressing, showing no sense of order, but I can no more observe order when \r\narranging these examples than I can in the rest of my work.) Plutarch was on board ship \r\nwhen he saw a dog which wanted to lap up some oil in the bottom of a jar; it could not \r\nget its tongue right down into the vessel because the neck was too narrow, so it went in \r\nsearch of pebbles which it dropped into the jar until the oil rose near to the top where it \r\ncould get at it. What is that if not the actions of a very subtle intelligence? It is said that \r\nBarbary ravens do the same when the water they want to drink is too low to get at. \r\n\r\nThe above action is somewhat akin to what is related by Juba (a king in elephant \r\ncountry): hunters cunningly prepare deep pits hidden beneath a cover of undergrowth; \r\nwhen an elephant is trapped in one, its fellows promptly bring a great many sticks and \r\nstones to help it clamber out. \r\n\r\nBut so many of their actions bring elephants close to human capacities that if I \r\nwanted to relate in detail everything that experience has shown us about them, I would \r\neasily win one of my regular arguments: that there is a greater difference between one \r\nman and another than between some men and some beasts. \r\n\r\nAn elephant-driver in a private household in Syria used to steal half the allotted \r\nrations at every feed. One day the master himself wanted to attend to things; he tipped \r\ninto the elephant’s manger the right measure of barley, as prescribed. The elephant \r\nglared at its driver and, with its trunk, set half the ration aside, to reveal the wrong done \r\nto it. Another elephant, whose driver used to adulterate its feed with stones, went up to \r\nthe pot where he was stewing meat for his own dinner and filled it with ashes. Those are \r\nspecial cases, but we all know from eye-witnesses that the strongest elements in the \r\narmies based in the Levant were elephants; their effectiveness surpassed what we can \r\nobtain nowadays from our artillery, which more or less replaces elephants in line of \r\nbattle (as can be easily judged by those who know their ancient history). \r\n\r\n\r\n[B] siquiclem Tirio servire solebant \r\n\r\n\r\n491 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnibali, et nostris ducibus, regique Molosso, \r\nHorum majores, et dorso ferre cohortes, \r\n\r\nPartem aliquam belli et euntem in praelia turmam. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Their sires served Hannibal of Carthage, as well as our generals and the Molossian \r\nKing, bearing on their backs into the fray cohorts and squadrons, and taking part in the \r\nbattle themselves.]<br /> t///"},{"idx":"0263286f-f9d4-4be0-a04c-622a577be93c","name":12,"NodeDescription":"///t <br /> \r\n\r\n[A] To make over to them like this the vanguard of their army soldiers must have \r\nseriously relied on the trustworthiness of these beasts and on their powers of reason; \r\nbecause of their size and bulk the slightest stoppage on their part or else the slightest \r\npanic making them head back towards their own side would be enough to undo \r\neverything. There are fewer examples of their turning and charging their own troops \r\nthan of us men charging back on each other in rout. They were entrusted not with one \r\nsimple manoeuvre but with several different roles in combat. \r\n\r\n[B] The Spaniards, likewise, employed dogs in their recent conquest of the \r\nAmerican Indies; they paid them like, soldiers and gave them a share in the booty. \r\nThose animals displayed eagerness and fierceness but no less skill and judgement, \r\nwhether in pursuing victory or in knowing when to stop, in charging or withdrawing as \r\nappropriate, and in telling friend from foe.- \r\n\r\n[A] Much more than everyday things, far-off things move us to wonder; they \r\nimpress us more; otherwise I would not have spent so much time over this long \r\ncatalogue; for, in my opinion, anyone who took careful note of the everyday animals we \r\nsee living among us would find them doing things just as astonishing as the examples we \r\ngather from far-off times and places. - [C] Nature is One and constant in her course. \r\nAnybody who could adequately understand her present state could draw reliable \r\nconclusions about all the future and all the past. \r\n\r\n[A] I once saw men brought to us from distant lands overseas. We could understand \r\nnothing of their language; their manners and even their features and clothing were far \r\ndifferent from ours. Which of us did not take them for brutes and savages? Which of us \r\ndid not attribute their silence to dullness and brutish ignorance? After all, they knew no \r\nFrench, were unaware of our hand-kissings and our low and complex bows, our bearing \r\nand our behaviour - such things must, of course, serve as a pattern for the whole human \r\nrace... \r\n\r\nEverything which seems strange we condemn, as well as everything we do not \r\nunderstand; that applies to our judgements on animals. Many of their characteristics are \r\nrelated to ours; that enables us to draw conjectures from comparisons. But they also \r\n\r\n\r\n492 \r\n\r\n\r\nhave qualities peculiar to themselves: what can we know about that? Horses, dogs, \r\ncattle, sheep, birds and most other animals living among men recognize our voices and \r\nare prepared to obey them. Why, Crassus even had a lamprey which came to him when \r\nhe called it, and there are eels in the fountain of Arethusa which do the same. [B] I have \r\nseen stews in plenty where the fish, on hearing a particular cry from those who tend \r\nthem, all rush to be fed. \r\n\r\n\r\n[A] nomen habent, et ad magistri \r\nVocem quisque sui venit citatus. \r\n\r\n\r\n[They have a name and each comes to its master when he calls them.] \r\n\r\n\r\n78 \r\n\r\n\r\nSuch evidence we can judge. \r\n\r\nWe can also go on to say that elephants have some notion of religion since, after \r\nablutions and purifications, they can be seen waving their trunks like arms upraised, \r\nwhile gazing intently at the rising sun; for long periods at fixed times in the day (by \r\ninstinct, not from teaching or precept) they stand rooted in meditation and \r\ncontemplation; there may be no obvious similarities in other animals, but that does not \r\nallow us to make judgements about their total lack of religion. When matters are hidden \r\nfrom us, we cannot in any way conceive them. \r\n\r\nWe can partly do so in the case of an activity noticed by Cleanthes the philosopher, \r\nbecause it resembles our own. He saw, he said, ants leave their own ant-hill for another \r\none, bearing the body of a dead ant. Several others came out to meet them, as if to \r\nparley. They remained together for some time; then the second group of ants went back \r\nto consult, it was thought, their fellow-citizens. They made two or three such journeys, \r\nbecause of hard bargaining. In the end, the newcomers brought a worm out from their \r\nheap, apparently as a ransom for the dead ant. The first lot loaded it on their shoulders \r\nand carried it back, leaving the body of the dead ant with the others. \r\n\r\nThat is the interpretation given by Cleanthes; it witnesses to the fact that voiceless \r\ncreatures are not deprived of mutual contact and communication; if we cannot share in \r\nit, that is because of a defect in us; we would be very stupid indeed to have any \r\nmeddlesome opinions on the matter. \r\n\r\nAnimals do many actions which surpass our understanding; far from being able to \r\nimitate them we cannot even conceive them in our thoughts. Many hold that in that last \r\ngreat sea-fight which Antony lost against Augustus, the flag-galley was stopped dead in \r\n\r\n\r\n493 \r\n\r\n\r\nits course by the fish which is called Remora (‘Hindrance’) since it has the property of \r\nhindering any ship it clings to. When the Emperor Caligula was sailing along the coast \r\nof Romania with a large fleet, his galley alone was pulled up short by this very fish. \r\nAttached as it was to the bottom of his vessel, he caused it to be seized, angry that so \r\nsmall a creature - it is a shellfish - could just cling by its mouth to his galley and outdo \r\nthe combined might of the sea, the winds and all his oarsmen. Understandably, he was \r\neven more amazed to learn that, once it was brought aboard ship, it no longer had the \r\npower it had had in the water. \r\n\r\nA citizen of Cyzicum once acquired a reputation as a good mathematical astrologer \r\nfrom noticing the practice of the hedgehog: its den is open in various places to various \r\nwinds; it can foretell from which direction the wind will blow and plugs up the hole on \r\nthe windward side. Observing that, he supplied the town with reliable forecasts about \r\nthe direction of the winds. \r\n\r\nThe chameleon takes on the colour of its surroundings, but the octopus assumes \r\nwhatever colour it likes to suit the occasion, hiding, say, from something fearful or \r\nlurking for its prey. The chameleon changes passively, the octopus actively. We change \r\nhue as well, from fear, anger, shame and other emotions which affect the colour of our \r\nfaces. That happens to us, as to the chameleon, passively. Jaundice, not our will, has the \r\npower to turn us yellow. \r\n\r\nSuch characteristics in other animals which we realize to surpass our own show that \r\nthey have, to an outstanding degree, a faculty which we classify as ‘occult’. Similarly, \r\nanimals probably have many other characteristics and powers [C] which are in no way \r\napparent to us. \r\n\r\n[A] Of all the omens of former times, the most ancient and the most certain were \r\nthose drawn from the flight of birds. We have nothing corresponding to that, nothing as \r\nwonderful. The beatings of the birds’ wings, from which consequences were drawn \r\nabout the future, show rule and order: only some very special means could produce so \r\nnoble an activity: to attribute so great an effect entirely to some ordinance of Nature, \r\nwithout any understanding, agreement and thought on the part of the creatures which \r\nperform it, is to be taken in by words; such an opinion is evidently false. Here is proof \r\nof that: the torpedo is a fish with the property of benumbing the limbs of anyone who \r\ndirectly touches it; in addition it can even send a numbing torpor into the hands of \r\nanyone touching it or handling it indirectly through a net or something similar. They \r\neven say that, if you pour water on to it, you can feel this effect working upwards, \r\nnumbing your sense of touch through the water. This force is worth marvelling at, but is \r\nnot without its usefulness to the torpedo; that fish knows it has it and uses it to trap its \r\n\r\n\r\n494 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprey when hunting; it snuggles down into the mud: other fish gliding overhead, struck by \r\nits cold torpor, are benumbed and fall into its power. \r\n\r\nCranes, swallows and other birds of passage which change dwellings with the \r\nseasons, clearly show that they are aware of their ability to foretell and put it to good \r\nuse. \r\n\r\nHunters assure us that the way to choose from a litter the puppy which will turn out \r\nbest is simply to make the bitch choose it herself: take the puppies out of their kennel \r\nand the first one she brings back will always prove the best; or else make a show of \r\nputting a ring of fire around their kennel; then take the first puppy she dashes in to \r\nrescue. From that it is obvious that either bitches have powers of foresight which we \r\nlack or else that they have a capacity for judging their young which is more lively than \r\nour own.- \r\n\r\nBeasts are born, reproduce, feed, move, live and die in ways so closely related to our \r\nown that, if we seek to lower their motivations or to raise our own status above theirs, \r\nthat cannot arise from any reasoned argument on our part. Doctors recommend us to \r\nlive and behave as animals do - and ordinary people have ever said: \r\n\r\n\r\nTenez chauts les pieds et la teste; \r\nAu demeurant, vivez en beste. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Keep feet and head warm: \r\nThen live like the beasts.] \r\n\r\n\r\nSexual generation is the principal natural action. Our human members are rather \r\nmore conveniently arranged for that purpose; and yet we are told that if we want to be \r\nreally effective we should adopt the position and posture of the animals: \r\n\r\n\r\nmore ferarum \r\n\r\nQuadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur \r\nConcipere uxores; quia sic loca sumere possunt, \r\nPectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Most think that wives conceive more readily in the posture of wild animals and four- \r\nfooted beasts; that is because the semen can find its way better when the breasts are low \r\ndown and the loins up-raised.] \r\n\r\n[AI] All those immodest and shameless movements that women have invented out of \r\n\r\n\r\n495 \r\n\r\n\r\ntheir own heads are condemned as positively harmful; women are advised to return to \r\nthe more modest and poised comportment of animals of their sex. \r\n\r\n\r\nNam mulier prohibet se concipere citque repugnat, \r\nClunibus ipsa viri Venerem si laeta retractet, \r\n\r\nAtque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctus. \r\n\r\nEjicit enim sulci recta regione viaque \r\nVomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum. \r\n\r\n\r\n[For the woman hinders or averts conception when passion leads her to withdraw \r\nVenus and her buttocks from the man, diverting the flow entirely over her yielding belly; \r\nshe makes the plough-share leap out of its furrow and broadcasts the seed where it does \r\nnot belong.]- \r\n\r\n[A] If justice consists in rendering everyone his due, then animals which serve, love \r\nand protect those that treat them well and which attack strangers and those that do them \r\nharm show some resemblance to aspects of our own justice; as they also do by \r\nmaintaining strict fair-shares for their young. \r\n\r\nAs for loving affection, theirs is incomparably more lively and consistent than men’s. \r\nKing Lisimachus had a dog called Hircanus. When its master died it remained \r\nstubbornly by his bed, refusing to eat or drink; when the day came to cremate the body, \r\nit ran dashing into the fire and was burned to death. The dog of a man called Pyrrhus \r\ndid the same: from the moment he died it would not budge off its master’s bed, and \r\nwhen they bore the body away, it let itself be carried off too, finally throwing itself into \r\nthe pyre as they were burning its master’s corpse. \r\n\r\nThere are also inclinations where our affection arises not from reasoned counsel but \r\nby that random chance sometimes called sympathy. Animals are capable of it too. We \r\ncan see horses grown so attracted to each other that we can hardly get them to live or \r\ntravel apart. We can see them attracted to a particular kind of coat among their fellow \r\nhorses, as we are to particular faces; whenever they come across it they straightway \r\napproach it with pleasure and display their affection, whereas they dislike or hate a \r\ndifferent kind of coat. \r\n\r\nAnimals, like us, have a choice of partners and select their females. Nor are they \r\nfree from our jealousies and great irreconcilable hatreds. \r\n\r\nDesires are either natural and necessary, like eating and drinking; natural and not \r\nnecessary, such as mating with a female; or else neither natural nor necessary, like \r\nvirtually all human ones, which are entirely superfluous and artificial. Nature needs \r\nwonderfully little to be satisfied and leaves little indeed for us to desire. The activities of \r\n\r\n\r\n496 \r\n\r\n\r\nour kitchens are not Nature’s ordinance. Stoics say that a man could feed himself on one \r\nolive a day. The choiceness of our wines owes nothing to Nature’s teachings, any more \r\nthan do the refinements we load on to our sexual appetites: \r\n\r\n\r\nneque ilia \r\n\r\nMagno prognatwn deposcit consule cunnum. \r\n\r\n\r\n[That does not demand a cunt descended from some great consul.]<br /> t///"},{"idx":"96c3d967-2168-45c1-a469-c5214e099ead","name":13,"NodeDescription":"///t <br /> \r\n\r\nFalse opinions and ignorance of the good have poured so many strange desires into \r\nus that they have chased away almost all the natural ones, no more nor less than if a \r\nmultitude of strangers in a city drove out all the citizens who were born there, snuffed \r\nout their ancient power and authority, seized the town and entirely usurped it. \r\n\r\nAnimals obey the rules of Nature better than we do and remain more moderately \r\nwithin her prescribed limits - though not so punctiliously as to be without something \r\nakin to our debaucheries. Just as there have been mad desires driving humans to fall in \r\nlove with beasts, so beasts have fallen in love with us, admitting monstrous passions \r\nacross species: witness the elephant which was the rival of Aristophanes the \r\nGrammarian for the affection of a young Alexandrian flower-girl and which was every \r\nbit as dutiful in its passion as he was: when walking through the fruit market it took fruit \r\nin its trunk and brought it to her. It never took its eyes off her except when it had to and \r\nsometimes slipped its trunk into her bosom through her neckband and stroked her \r\nbreasts. We are also told of a dragon which fell in love with a maiden; of a goose \r\nenamoured of a boy in the town of Asopus, and of a ram which sighed for Glaucia the \r\nminstrel-girl - and baboons falling madly in love with women are an everyday \r\noccurrence. You can also see some male animals falling for males of their own kind. \r\n\r\nOppianus- and others relate some examples to show that beasts in their couplings \r\nrespect the laws of kinship, but experience frequently shows us the contrary: \r\n\r\n\r\nnee habetur turpe juvencae \r\nFerre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux; \r\nQuasque creavit init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus \r\nSemine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales. \r\n\r\n\r\n[The heifer feels no shame if covered by the sire nor does the mare; the billy-goat \r\ngoes on to the nanny-goats he has fathered, and birds conceive from the semen that \r\n\r\n\r\n497 \r\n\r\n\r\nbegot them.]- \r\n\r\nHas there ever been a more express case of subtle malice than that of the mule of \r\nThales the philosopher? Laden with salt, it chanced to stumble when fording a river, so \r\nwetting the sacks; noticing that the salt dissolved and lightened its load, it never failed, \r\nwhenever it could, to plunge fully loaded into a stream. Eventually its master discovered \r\nits trick and ordered it to be laden with wool. Finding its expectations deceived, it gave \r\nup that trick. \r\n\r\nSome animals so naturally mirror the face of human avarice that you can see them \r\nstealing anything they can and hiding it carefully, even though they never have any use \r\nfor it. \r\n\r\nAs for household management beasts surpass us in the foresight necessary to gather \r\nand store for the future, and also possess many of the kinds of knowledge required to do \r\nso. When ants notice their grain or seeds going mouldy and smelling badly, they stop \r\nthem from spoiling or going rotten by spreading them on the ground outside their \r\nstorehouses, airing, drying and freshening them up. But the measures and precautions \r\nthey take to gnaw out their grains of corn surpass any imaginable human foresight. Corn \r\ndoes not always stay dry and wholesome but gets soft, flabby and milky, as a step \r\ntowards germinating and sprouting anew; to stop it turning to seed-corn and losing its \r\nnature and properties as grain in store for future use, ants gnaw off the end which does \r\nthe sprouting. \r\n\r\nAs for war - the most grandiose and glorious of human activities - I would like to \r\nknow whether we want to use it to prove our superiority or, on the contrary, to prove \r\nour weakness and imperfection. We know how to defeat and kill each other, to \r\nundermine and destroy our own species: not much there, it seems, to make them want to \r\nlearn from us. \r\n\r\n\r\n[B] quando leoni \r\n\r\nFortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam \r\nExpiravit aper majoris dentibus apri? \r\n\r\n\r\n[When has a stronger lion ever torn life from a weaker lion?

We still recall how the Portuguese were \r\ninvesting the town of Tamly in their territory of Xiatime when the inhabitants, who had \r\nhives in plenty, carried a great many of them to their walls and smoked the bees out so \r\nvigorously that their enemies were unable to sustain their stinging attacks and were all \r\nput to rout. They owed the freedom of their town and their victory to such novel \r\nreinforcements - and with so happy an outcome that not one bee was reported \r\nmissing.- \r\n\r\n[A] The souls of Emperors and of cobblers are cast in the same mould. We consider \r\nthe importance of the actions of Princes and their weight and then persuade ourselves \r\nthat they are produced by causes equally weighty, equally important. In that we deceive \r\nourselves. They are tossed to and fro by the same principles as we are. The reasons that \r\nmake us take issue with a neighbour lead Princes to start a war; the same reason which \r\nmakes us flog a lackey makes kings lay waste a province. [B] They can do more but can \r\nwish as lightly. [Al] The same desires trouble a fleshworm and an elephant. \r\n\r\n[A] As for faithfulness, there is no animal in the world whose treachery can compete \r\nwith Man’s. Our history books tell of certain dogs which vigorously reacted to the \r\nmurders of their masters. King Pyrrhus once came across a dog guarding the body of its \r\ndead master; when he was told the dog had done this duty for three days, he ordered the \r\ncorpse to be buried and took the dog away with him. Later, when he was making a \r\ngeneral review of his troops the dog recognized the murderers of its master and ran at \r\nthem barking loudly and angrily. This was the first piece of evidence leading to its \r\nmaster’s murder being avenged; justice was soon done in the courts. The dog of Hesiod \r\nthe Wise did the same, leading to the sons of Ganistor (a man from Naupactus) being \r\n\r\n\r\n501 \r\n\r\n\r\nconvicted of the murder of its master. \r\n\r\nAnother dog was guarding a temple in Athens when it spotted a thief sacrilegiously \r\nmaking off with the finest jewels. It began barking at him as loud as it could, but the \r\ntemple sextons never woke up; so the dog started to trail the thief and, when day broke, \r\nhung behind a little without losing him from sight. When the thief offered it food, it \r\nrefused to take anything from him, whilst accepting it from others who passed by, \r\ntreating them all to a good wagging of its tail. When the thief stopped to sleep, so did \r\nthe dog, in the same place. News of this dog reached the sextons of that church; they set \r\nout to find it; by making enquiries about the colour of its coat, they eventually caught up \r\nwith it at Cromyon. The thief was there too; they brought him back to Athens, where he \r\nwas punished. In recognition of its good sense of duty, the judges awarded the dog a \r\nfixed measure of wheat out of public funds to pay for its keep and ordered the priests to \r\nlook after it. This happened in Plutarch’s own time and he himself asserts that the \r\naccount was very thoroughly vouched for. \r\n\r\nAs for gratitude - and it seems to me that we could well bring this word back into \r\nrepute - one example will suffice. Apion relates it as something he had seen himself. He \r\ntells how, one day, the people of Rome were given the pleasure of watching several \r\nstrange animals fight - mainly, in fact, unusually big lions; one of these drew the eyes of \r\nthe entire audience by its wild bearing, the strength and size of its limbs and its proud \r\nand terrifying roar. Amongst the slaves presented to the populace to fight with these \r\nbeasts was Androdus, a slave from Dacia, belonging to a Roman lord of consular rank. \r\nThis lion, seeing him from afar, first pulled up short, as though struck with wonder; it \r\nthen came gently towards him; its manner was soft and peaceful, as if it expected to \r\nrecognize an acquaintance. Then, having made certain of what it was looking for, it \r\nbegan to wag its tail as dogs do when fondly greeting their masters; it kissed and licked \r\nthe hands and thighs of that poor wretch, who was beside himself, ecstatic with fear. \r\nThe gracious behaviour of the lion brought Androdus back to himself so that he fixed \r\nhis gaze on it, staring at it and then recognizing it. It was a rare pleasure to see the happy \r\ngreetings and blandishments they lavished on each other. The populace raised shouts of \r\njoy; the Emperor sent for the slave to leam how this strange event had come about. He \r\ngave him an account, novel and wonderful: ‘My Master’, he said, ‘was a proconsul in \r\nAfrica; he treated me so cruelly and so harshly, flogging me every day, that I was forced \r\nto steal myself from him and run away. I found the quickest way to hide myself safely \r\nfrom a person having such great Provincial authority was to make for that country’s \r\nuninhabited sandy deserts, fully resolved, if there was no means of keeping myself in \r\nfood, to kill myself. The midday sun was so fierce and the heat so intolerable that when \r\nI stumbled on a hidden cave, difficult of access, I plunged into it. Soon afterwards this \r\n\r\n\r\n502 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlion came in, its paw all wounded and bloody; it was groaning and whining with pain. I \r\nwas very frightened when it arrived but, when it saw me hiding in a corner of its lair, it \r\ncame gently up to me and showed me its wounded paw, as though asking for help. I \r\nremoved a great splinter of wood; when I had made it a little more used to me, I \r\nsqueezed out the filthy pus that had collected in the wound, wiped it and made it as \r\nclean as I could. The lion, aware that things were better and that the pain had been \r\nrelieved, began to rest, falling asleep with its paw in my hands. After that we lived \r\ntogether in that cave for three whole years; we ate the same food since the lion brought \r\nme choice morsels of the animals it had killed in the hunt; I had no fire but I fed myself \r\nby cooking the meat in the heat of the sun. In the end I grew disgusted with this savage, \r\nbrutish life and so, when the lion had gone out one day on its usual quest for food, I \r\nslipped away. Three days later I was surprised by soldiers who brought me from Africa \r\nto Rome and handed me over to my master. He promptly condemned me to die by \r\nbeing exposed to the beasts in the arena. I realize now that the lion was also captured \r\nsoon afterwards and that it wanted to repay me for my kindness in curing its wound.’ \r\n\r\nThat is the account which Androdus told to the Emperor and which he also spread \r\nfrom mouth to mouth. Androdus was given his freedom by general acclaim and relieved \r\nof his sentence; by order of the people he was made a gift of the lion. \r\n\r\nEver since, says Apion, we can see Androdus leading the lion about on a short leash, \r\ngoing from tavern to tavern in Rome collecting money, while the lion lets itself be \r\nstrewn with flowers. All who meet them say: ‘There goes the Lion, host to the Man: \r\nthere goes the Man, doctor to the Lion.’- \r\n\r\n\r\n503 \r\n\r\n\r\n[B] We often shed tears at the loss of animals which we love: they do the same when \r\nthey lose us: \r\n\r\n\r\nPost, bellator equus, positis insignibus, Aethon \r\nIt lachrymans, guttisque humectat grandibus ora. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Then comes Aethon, the war-horse, stripped of its insignia, weeping and drenching \r\nits face in mighty tears. ]<br /> t///"},{"idx":"b91fed27-7ce3-4ea5-b617-1739c3b5c47b","name":16,"NodeDescription":"///t <br /> \r\n\r\nSome peoples hold their wives in common while in others each man has a wife of \r\nhis own; can we not see the same among the beasts? Do they not have marriages better \r\nkept than our own? \r\n\r\n[A] As touching the confederations and alliances which animals make to league \r\nthemselves together for mutual succour, oxen, pigs and other animals can be seen \r\nrushing in to help when one of their number is being attacked and rallying round in its \r\ndefence. If a scar-fish swallows a fisherman’s hook, its fellows swarm around and bite \r\nthrough the line; if one of them happens to get caught in a wicker trap, the others dangle \r\ntheir tails down into it from outside while it holds on grimly with its teeth. In this way \r\nthey drag it right out. When a barbel-fish is hooked, the others stiffen the spine which \r\nprojects from their backs; it is notched like a saw; they rub it against the line and saw it \r\nthrough. \r\n\r\nAs for the special duties we render to each other in the service of life, there are \r\nseveral similar examples amongst the animals. The whale, it is said, never travels \r\nwithout a tiny fish like a sea-gudgeon swimming ahead of it (for this reason it is called a \r\n‘guide-fish’). The whale follows it everywhere, allowing itself to be directed and steered \r\nas easily as a rudder turns a boat. Everything else - beast or ship - which falls into the \r\nswirling chaos of that creature’s mouth is straightway lost and swallowed up: yet that \r\nlittle fish can retire there and sleep in its mouth in complete safety. While it is asleep, \r\nthe whale never budges, but as soon as it swims out, the whale constantly follows it; if it \r\nshould chance to lose its guide-fish it flounders about all over the place, often dashing \r\nitself to pieces against the rocks like a rudderless ship. Plutarch testifies to having seen \r\nthis happen on the island of Anticyra. \r\n\r\nThere is a similar companionship between the tiny wren and the crocodile: the wren \r\nstands guard over that big creature; when the crocodile’s enemy, the ichneumon, closes \r\nin for a fight, this little bird is afraid that its companion may be caught napping, so it \r\npecks it awake and sings to warn it of danger. The wren lives on the leftovers of that \r\nmonstrous crocodile, which welcomes it into its jaws and lets it pick at the meat stuck \r\n\r\n\r\n504 \r\n\r\n\r\nbetween its teeth. If it wants to shut its mouth it warns the wren to fly out by gradually \r\nclosing its jaws a little, without squashing it or harming it in any way. \r\n\r\nThe shellfish called a nacre lives in similar company with the pinnothere, a kind of \r\nsmall crab which serves it as tout and doorkeeper; squatting by the orifice which the \r\nnacre always keeps half-open, it waits until some little fish worth catching swims into it. \r\nThe crab then slips into the nacre, pinching its living flesh to make it close its shell. \r\nHaving imprisoned the fish they both set about eating it. \r\n\r\nThree parts of Mathematics are particularly well known to tunny-fish: the way they \r\nlive shows that. \r\n\r\nFirst, Astrology; it is they who teach it to men: wherever they may be when \r\nsurprised by the winter solstice, there they remain until the following equinox (which \r\nexplains why even Aristotle readily allows them a knowledge of that science). \r\n\r\nNext Geometry and Arithmetic: tunny-fish always form up in the shape of a cube, \r\nequally square on all sides. Drawing themselves up into a solid battalion, a corps \r\nenclosed and protected all round by six faces of equal size, they swim about in this \r\norder, square before, square behind - so that if you count one line of them you have the \r\ncount of the whole school, since the same figure applies to their depth, breadth and \r\nlength. \r\n\r\nAs for greatness of spirit, it would be hard to express it more clearly than that great \r\ndog did which was sent to King Alexander from India. It was first presented with a stag, \r\nnext with a boar, then with a bear: it did not deign to come out and fight them, but as \r\nsoon as it saw a lion it leaped to its feet, clearly showing that it thought such an animal \r\nwas indeed worthy of the privilege of fighting against it. \r\n\r\n[B] Touching repentance and the acknowledging of error, they tell of an elephant \r\nwhich killed its master in a fit of anger; its grief was so intense that it refused to eat and \r\nstarved itself to death. \r\n\r\n[A] As for clemency, they tell of a tiger - the most inhuman of all beasts - which \r\nwas given a goat to eat. It fasted for two days before being even tempted to harm it; by \r\nthe third day, it considered the goat as a familiar guest, so, rather than attack it, it broke \r\nout of its cage and sought food elsewhere. \r\n\r\nAs for rights bred of familiarity and friendly converse, it is quite normal to train \r\ncats, dogs and hares to live tamely together. \r\n\r\nBut surpassing all human imagination is what experience has taught travellers by sea \r\n- especially those in the sea of Sicily - about the halcyons. Has Nature ever honoured \r\n\r\n\r\n505 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany creature as she has honoured these kingfishers in their procreation, lying-in and \r\nbirth? The poets feign that one single island, Delos, was a floating land before being \r\nanchored so that Latona might give birth upon it. But God himself has wished the entire \r\nsea to be settled, smooth and calm, free from wave and wind and rain, on those halcyon \r\ndays when these creatures produce their young. (This befalls, precisely, about the \r\nshortest day of the year, the solstice: this privilege of theirs gives us seven days and \r\nnights at the very heart of the winter, when, without danger, we can sail the seas.) Each \r\nfemale knows no male but its own; it helps it all its life and never forsakes it. If the male \r\nis weak or crippled the female carries it everywhere on her back, serving it till death. \r\n\r\nBut no ingenuity has ever fathomed the miraculous artifice by which the halcyons \r\nbuild their nest for their young nor divined its fabric. Plutarch saw several of them and \r\nhandled them. He thinks they may be composed of the bones of certain fish, joined, \r\nbound and interwoven together, some lengthwise, some crosswise; bent and rounded \r\nstruts are then added, eventually forming a coracle ready to float upon the water. The \r\nfemale halcyon then brings them where they can be lapped around by the waves of the \r\nsea. The salt water gently beats upon them, showing her where ill-fitting joints need \r\ndaubing and where she needs to strengthen the sections where her construction is \r\ncoming loose or pulling apart at the beating of the sea. On the other hand this battering \r\nby the waves binds all the good joints up tight and knits them so close that they can only \r\nwith difficulty be smashed, broken or even damaged by blows with stone or iron. Most \r\nwonderful of all are the shape and proportions of the concave hold, for it is shaped and \r\nproportioned to admit only one creature snugly: the one who made it. To everything else \r\nit is closed, barred and impenetrable. Nothing can get in, not even sea water. \r\n\r\nThat is a fine description of this construction, taken from a fine book. Yet even that, \r\nit seems to me, fails to enlighten us adequately about the difficulty of such architecture. \r\nWhat silly vanity leads us to take products we can neither imitate nor understand, range \r\nthem beneath us and treat them with disdain.- \r\n\r\nLet us go further into such equalities and correspondences between us and the \r\nbeasts. The human soul takes pride in its privilege of bringing all its conceptions into \r\nharmony with its own condition: everything it conceives is stripped of its mortal and \r\nphysical qualities; it compels everything which it judges worthy of notice to divest itself \r\ncompletely of such of its own conditions as are corruptible - of all physical accidents \r\nsuch as depth, length, breadth, weight, colour, smell, roughness, smoothness, hardness, \r\nsoftness; it casts them aside like old garments; it clothes everything in its own condition, \r\nspiritual and immortal: the Rome or the Paris which exists in my soul - the Paris \r\nimagined in thought - is conceived in my imagination without size, without place, \r\n\r\n\r\n506 \r\n\r\n\r\nwithout stone, without plaster, without wood. Well, that self-same privilege seems \r\nevidently shared with the beasts; for, asleep on its litter, a war-horse accustomed to \r\ntrumpet, harquebus and combat can be seen twitching and trembling as though in the \r\nthick of battle: clearly its mind is conceiving a drum without drum-beats, an army \r\nwithout arms, without physical body. \r\n\r\n\r\nQuippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt \r\nIn somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque saepe, \r\n\r\nEt quasi de palma summas contendere vires. \r\n\r\n\r\n[You can, indeed, see vigorous racehorses, resting their limbs in sleep, yet often \r\nsweating and panting as though disputing the prize with all their might.] \r\n\r\nThe greyhound imagines a hare in a dream: we can see it panting after it in its sleep \r\nas it stretches out its tail, twitches its thighs and exactly imitates its movements in the \r\nchase: that hare has no coat and no bones. \r\n\r\n\r\nVenantumque canes in molli saepe quiete \r\nJactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente \r\nMittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras, \r\n\r\nUt vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum. \r\nExpergefactique sequuntur inania saepe \r\nCervorum simulachra, fugae quasi dedita cernant: \r\nDonee discussis redeant erroribus ad se. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Often hunting dogs lying quietly asleep, suddenly paw about, bark out loud and \r\nsharply draw their breath as if they were on the track of their prey. Even after they have \r\nstarted out of their sleep they still pursue that empty ghost of a stag as though they could \r\nsee it fleeing before them, until the error fades and they come back to themselves.] \r\n\r\nGuard dogs can be found growling in their sleep, then yapping and finally waking \r\nwith a start as though they saw some stranger coming: that stranger which their souls \r\ncan see is a spiritual man, not perceptible to the senses, without dimensions, without \r\ncolour and without being. \r\n\r\n\r\nconsueta domi catulorum blanda propago \r\nDegere, saepe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem \r\nDiscutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant, \r\nProinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tueantur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[The dog, that fawning creature at home in our houses, often quivers its eyelids in \r\n\r\n\r\n507 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwinged sleep and starts to its feet as if it saw the faces and features of strangers. ]<br /> t///"},{"idx":"4bab3ce8-4013-4ef7-879a-dddf828d4a3e","name":17,"NodeDescription":"///t <br /> \r\n\r\nAs for physical beauty, before I can go any further I need to know if we can agree \r\nover its description.

But the wretchedness of our human \r\ncondition means we have less to relish than to banish: the most extreme pleasures touch \r\nus less than the lightest of pains: [C] ‘Segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt’ [Men \r\nfeel pleasure more dully than pain]. [A] We are far less aware of perfect health than of \r\nthe slightest illness: \r\n\r\n\r\npungit \r\n\r\nIn cute vix summa violatum plagula corpus, \r\n\r\n\r\n517 \r\n\r\n\r\nQuando valere nihil quemquam movet.

Personally I feel delight in simply being free from pain in \r\nfoot or side, while another scarcely realizes he is well and remains unaware of his good \r\nhealth.] \r\n\r\nFor us, being well means not being ill. So that philosophical school which sets the \r\nhighest value on pleasure reduces it to the mere absence of pain. To be free from ill is \r\nthe greatest good that Man can hope for. [C] As Ennius puts it, \r\n\r\n\r\nNimium boni est, cui nihil est mali \r\n\r\n\r\n[Ample good consists in being free from ill]. \r\n\r\n[A] For even that tickling excitement which accompanies certain pleasures and \r\nwhich seems to exalt us above mere good health and freedom from pain, that shifting \r\ndelight, active, inexplicably biting and sharp, aims in the end at freedom from pain. The \r\nappetite which enraptures us when we lie with women merely aims at banishing the pain \r\nbrought on by the frenzy of our inflamed desires; all it seeks is rest and repose, free \r\nfrom the fever of passion. \r\n\r\nThe same applies to all other appetites. I maintain, therefore, that if ignorant \r\nsimplicity can bring us to an absence of pain, then it brings us to a state which, given the \r\nhuman condition, is very blessedness. \r\n\r\n[C] Yet we should not think of a simplicity so leaden as to be unable to taste \r\nanything. Crantor was right to attack ‘freedom from pain’ as conceived by Epicurus, \r\ninsofar as it was built upon foundations so deep that pain could not even draw near to it \r\nor arise within it. I have no words of praise for a ‘freedom from pain’ which is neither \r\npossible nor desirable. I am pleased enough not to be ill but, if I am ill, I want to know; \r\nif you cut me open or cauterize me, I want to feel it. Truly, anyone who could uproot all \r\nknowledge of pain would equally eradicate all knowledge of pleasure and finally destroy \r\nMan: ‘Istud nihil dolere, non sine magna mercede contingit immanitatis in animo, stuporis \r\nin corpore’ [That ‘freedom from pain’ has a high price: cruelty in the soul, insensate \r\ndullness in the body]. For Man, ill can be good at times; it is not always right to flee \r\npain, not always right to chase after pleasure. \r\n\r\n\r\n518 \r\n\r\n\r\n[A] It greatly advances the honour of Ignorance that Learning has to throw us into \r\nher arms when powerless to stiffen our backs against the weight of our ills; she has to \r\nmake terms, slipping the reins and giving us leave to seek refuge in the lap of Ignorance, \r\nfinding under her protection a shelter from the blows and outrages of Fortune. \r\n\r\nLearning instructs us to [C] withdraw our thoughts from the ills which beset us now \r\nand to occupy them by recalling the good times we have known; [A] to make use of the \r\nmemory of past joys in order to console ourselves for present sorrows, or to call in the \r\nhelp of vanished happiness to set against the things which oppress us now - [C] \r\n‘Levationes aegritudinum in avocatione a cogitanda molestia et revocatione ad \r\ncontemplandas voluptates ponit’ [He found a way to lessen sorrows by summoning \r\nthoughts away from troubles and calling them back to gaze on pleasure] - [A] when \r\nLearning runs out of force, she turns to cunning; when strength of arm and body fails, \r\nshe resorts to conjuring tricks and nimble footwork; if that is not what is meant, what \r\ndoes it mean?

Xenophon records a similar confusion in the teachings \r\nof Socrates: sometimes he has Socrates maintaining that no inquiry should be made into \r\nthe properties of God; at other times he has him deciding that the Sun is God, that the \r\nsoul is God, that there is only one God and then that there are many. The nephew of \r\nPlato, Speusippus, holds God to be a certain animate Power governing all things; \r\nAristotle sometimes says that God is Mind and sometimes the World; at times he gives \r\nthe world a different Master and sometimes makes a god from the heat of the sky. \r\nZenocrates has eight gods: five are named after the planets; the sixth has all the fixed \r\nstars as his members, the seventh and eighth being the Sun and Moon. Heraclides of \r\nPontus meanders along beneath these various notions and ends up with. God deprived of \r\nall sensation; he has him changing from one form to another and finally asserts that he is \r\nheaven and earth. Theophrastus is similarly undecided, wandering about between his \r\nmany concepts, attributing the government of the world sometimes to Intelligence, \r\nsometimes to the sky and sometimes to the stars; Strato says God is Nature, giving birth, \r\nmaking things wax and wane, but itself formless and insensate; Zeno makes a god of \r\nNatural Law: it commands good, forbids evil and is animate; he dismisses the gods \r\naccepted by custom -Jupiter, Juno and Vesta; Diogenes of Apollonia says God is Time. \r\nXenophanes makes God round, able to see and hear but not to breathe and having \r\nnothing in common with human nature; Ariston thinks that the form of God cannot be \r\ngrasped: he deprives him of senses and cannot tell whether he is animate or something \r\nquite different. For Cleanthes God is sometimes Reason, sometimes the World, \r\nsometimes the Soul of Nature, sometimes absolute Heat surrounding and enveloping all \r\nthings. Perseus, a pupil of Zeno’s, maintained that the name god was bestowed on \r\npeople who had contributed some outstandingly useful improvements to the life of Man \r\n- or even on the improvements themselves.

Let the saliva of some wretched dog \r\nslaver over the hand of Socrates and they knew that it would put a sudden end to all his \r\nwisdom and to all his mighty, disciplined thought, reducing them to nothing, so that no \r\ntrace whatever would remain of his original awareness: \r\n\r\n[B] vis animai \r\n\r\n\r\nConturbatur,... et divisa seorsum \r\nDisjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno. \r\n\r\n\r\n[The power of the soul is disturbed and its parts are broken up and dispersed by that \r\nsame poison.] \r\n\r\n[A] They knew that the poison would find no greater powers of resistance in his soul \r\nthan in a four-year-old’s: if Philosophy herself became incarnate, such a poison would \r\nmake her lose her senses and drive her insane.

The human mind is a great forger of miracles, we know that: but this \r\nrelationship has something abnormal about it which I cannot define; you can even see it \r\nin names, events and thousands of other ways. [B] For we have newly discovered \r\npeoples who, as far as we know, have never heard of us, yet where they believe in \r\ncircumcision; where countries or great states are entirely governed by women, without \r\nmen; where you can find something like our Lenten fasts, with the addition of sexual \r\nabstinence. We have found peoples where our crosses are honoured in various ways (in \r\none place they even displayed them prominently on their graves); in another crosses \r\nwere used (especially the cross of St Andrew) to ward off nocturnal visions; they also \r\nput them on their children’s beds against enchantments. Elsewhere was discovered a \r\nwooden cross, immensely tall, which was worshipped as the god of rain - and that was \r\nvery far from the coast. Also found there were the express image of our penitents, the \r\nuse of mitres, the practice of priestly celibacy, the art of divination from the entrails of \r\nsacrificed animals, [C] a total abstention from all kinds of fish and flesh, [B] the custom \r\nfor priests to make liturgical use of a special tongue not the common one; the idea that \r\n\r\n\r\nthe first god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; the belief that they were \r\ncreated with all kinds of advantages which were subsequently cut off because of their \r\nsin; their land changed and their natural condition made harsher; they were submerged \r\nby a heaven-sent flood, only a few families being saved who had taken refuge in high \r\nmountain caves, which they blocked up to stop the waters getting in; various species of \r\nanimals were shut in there too; when they thought the rain had ceased, dogs were sent \r\nout: they came back dripping wet and clean, so it was judged that the waters had only \r\nbegun to subside; later other dogs were sent out. When they returned all covered in mud \r\nthe humans emerged to re-people the world, which they found to be full of nothing but \r\nsnakes. \r\n\r\nIn one case the inhabitants were convinced of a Day of Judgement. When the \r\nSpaniards scattered the bones of their dead about as they plundered their graves in \r\nsearch of treasure, they were beside themselves with anger, declaring that such scattered \r\nbones could not easily be put together again. They have trade by barter (but no other) \r\nwith fairs and markets for this purpose; they have dwarves and deformed people to \r\nenliven the banquets of their princes; falconry they have, but with their own native birds; \r\nthey have tyrannous taxation, elegant gardens, acrobats, dancing, musical instruments, \r\ncoats-of-arms, tennis-courts, games of dice and chance - at which they get so carried \r\naway that they stake themselves and their freedom; they have medicine based entirely on \r\nmagic charms, pictorial writing, a belief in one first man who was father of all peoples; \r\nthey have the worship of a god who once lived as a Man in perfect celibacy, abstinence \r\nand penitence, preaching the law of Nature and liturgical ceremonies and who \r\ndisappeared from the world without a natural death; a belief in giants, the custom of \r\ngetting drunk on their local drink and seeing who can down the most, religious \r\nornaments painted with bones and death’s heads, surplices, holy water and aspergilla, \r\nwomen and servants who gaily volunteer to be burnt or buried alive with their husband \r\nor masters, laws of inheritance which leave everything to the eldest son and set nothing \r\nbut obedience aside for the younger one, the custom that a man promoted to high rank \r\nadopts a new name and abandons his old one, the custom of sprinkling chalk on the \r\nknee of a newborn babe, saying to him: ‘Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return’; \r\nand they have the art of augury. \r\n\r\nSuch vain shadows of our religion as may be seen in some of these examples witness \r\nto its dignity and holiness: it has penetrated into infidel nations on our side of the world \r\nby a kind of imitation, but to those natives of far-off lands it came by a shared \r\nsupernatural inspiration.

(Therefore we ought not to \r\n\r\n\r\n615 \r\n\r\n\r\ntake comfort from our souls’ being happy and satisfied with the senses we do have; if we \r\nare deprived and imperfect, our souls have no way of sensing it.) It is impossible to say \r\nanything to that blind man by reason, argument or comparison, which will fix in his \r\nunderstanding what light, colour and sight really are. There is nothing beyond the senses \r\nwhich can supply evidence of them. We do find people who are born blind expressing a \r\nwish to see: that does not mean that they know what they are asking for.

He has so little knowledge of what he is lacking that he is \r\nalways using words appropriate to seeing, just as we do; he applies them in his own \r\npeculiar way. When he was presented with one of his own godchildren, he took him in \r\nhis arms and said: ‘My God, what a handsome child. How nice to see him! What a \r\nhappy face he has.’ He will say (like one of us): ‘What a lovely view there is from this \r\nroom! What a clear day. How bright the sun is.’ And that is not all. Hearing how much \r\nwe enjoy the sports of hunting, tennis and shooting, he likes them, too; he tries to join in \r\nand believes that he can take part like us. He gets carried away, has a great deal of fun \r\nand yet has no knowledge at all of these sports, except through the ears. On open \r\nground, where he can use his spurs, somebody shouts, ‘There goes a hare.’ Then \r\nsomebody says, ‘Look, the hare has been caught.’ You will see him as proud of the kill \r\nas other men he has heard. \r\n\r\nAt tennis he takes the ball in his left hand and hits it with his racket.

How can we know that the difficulties we have in \r\nunderstanding many of the works of Nature do not derive from this, or that several of \r\nthe actions of animals which exceed our powers of understanding are produced by a \r\nsense-faculty which we do not possess? Perhaps some of them, by such means, enjoy a \r\nfuller life, a more complete life than we do. \r\n\r\nWe need virtually all our senses merely to recognize an apple: we recognize redness \r\nin it, sheen, smell and sweetness.
